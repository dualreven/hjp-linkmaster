### Hotkeys:

If you use Anki 2.1: By default Anki uses "F3" for adding media. If you want to use the default keybinding of this add-on for "Next result" which is also "F3" in Anki 2.1 you need the add-on [Customize Keyboard Shortcuts](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/24411424). In the config of this add-on change "editor add media" to a different key.

You have to restart Anki so that changes take effect.

- `HOTKEY_SEARCH` (default is `CTRL + F`). This opens a search bar at the bottom of the window which allows you to search the editor. This shortcut works in the Add window and the EditCurrent window (you see the latter if you press "e" during reviews).
- `HOTKEY_SEARCH_BROWSER` (default is `CTRL + Alt + Shift + F`): There is a separate shortcut for the browser because in the browser window there are fewer easy-to-use shortcuts unused.
- `Close search` (default is `Esc`).
- `Next result` (default is `F3`).
- `Previous result` (default is `Shift+F3`).
