#
# As part of porting this add-on to Anki 2.1 I had to move the 
# main add-on module to a separate folder. It is now located under
# common_ctrlf_search/common_ctrlf_search.py. 
# All configuration options are located
# at the very top of that file.

# Please use NotePad++ or another text editor that supports python
# source code files to edit it
