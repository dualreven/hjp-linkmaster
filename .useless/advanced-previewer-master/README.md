### Credits and License

This add-on was originally developed on a commission
by [BB on the Anki support forums](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/8504-100-for-add-on-developer). The
card reviewing feature introduced in the latest update was commissioned by another fellow Anki user who would like to
remain anonymous. I would like to thank both of them for their great ideas and generous support in writing this add-on.
